To deploy static files:
1. Go to settings.py
2. Set DEBUG=False (comes as True by default)
3. Add STATIC_ROOT='static'
4. Add the following to the .config file:
container_commands:
  collectstatic:
    command: "source /var/app/venv/*/bin/activate && python3 manage.py collectstatic --noinput"
option_settings:
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:staticfiles:
    /static: static

This will collect all your static files in one location and deploy it.
